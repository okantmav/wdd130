      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Develop a web site for a fortnightly budget and expenses tracker.
        I want to help people with their personal finances budget and expenses applying the gospel
        principles for self-reliance and the 50/30/20 budget rule.
        The web site will help people becoming a wise and faithful steward under a unified approach to
        finances. This site will help to remind paying tithes and offerings. This web site will teach people
        to create a budget and stick to this protecting their family from hardship. This site pretends to
        help to understand debt and show a way to get out of debt. Managing financial crises and
        investing for the future is a hard goal to achieve, but this is a continuous to blessing for us and
        others.
        This web site will be based on Personal Finances for Self-Reliance Published by The Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
        What if we are in financial crises? I could be great to know how to get out of debt and know a
        way to manage the financial crises.</p> <!-- change this -->
