          <h2>1 Learning to be grateful and becoming wise</h2>
          <p>“Look to the condition of your finances. and be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your
            purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from
            bondage. ” (“To the Boys and to the Men,” Ensign, Nov. 1998, 54)</p>

          <h2>2 Understanding Budgets</h2>
          <p>"A budget is a plan. Using a budget, you plan how you will use your money for a certain period of time.
            Following a budget will help you and your family take control of your temporal life… Budgeting can also help
            you to protect your family from hardship as you use it to allocate money for building an emergency fund,
            paying down debt, and saving for future expenses. We cannot predict the future, and costs often arise
            unexpectedly. It is important to remember that a budget must be flexible—continually adjusted and improved.
            When you create a budget… remember that it will need to be consistently reviewed and revised. If you go over
            budget, don’t give up! It may take several months of adjustments before you have an effective budget."</p>

          <h2>3 Understanding Debt</h2>
          <p>"Debt is borrowing money that is not yours. It typically comes with a cost, known as interest. Interest is
            a percentage of the amount owed. You end up paying more for what you borrowed, sometimes a lot more. Debts
            come with expected payments, and an overall expectation to repay all that you borrowed plus interest."</p>

          <h2>4 Learning to Invest</h2>
          <p>"When people hear the term investing, they may think of a loud and chaotic trading floor with people
            selling
            stocks and bonds. While that may be part of investing, investing is also the act of putting time, effort, or
            money into something and expecting some type of a return. In this sense, investing is an element of
            self-reliance. You will explore three ways to invest: 1. Save money 2. Pursue home ownership 3. Seek
            education"</p>

          <h2>5 Teach others, practice gratitude</h2>
          <p>"When we become temporally self-reliant, it is our duty to help others also become temporally self-reliant.
            One of the best ways to help others become self-reliant is serving and giving to others." "A unified
            approach to financial stewardship can ultimately bring gratitude, harmony, and peace...”</p>
