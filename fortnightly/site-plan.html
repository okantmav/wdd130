        investing for the future is a hard goal to achieve, but this is a continuous to blessing for us and
        others.
        This web site will be based on Personal Finances for Self-Reliance Published by The Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

      <h3>Self-reliance</h3>
      <p>
        “Without self-reliance one cannot exercise these innate desires to serve. How can we give if there is nothing there? Food for the hungry cannot come from empty shelves. Money to assist the needy cannot come from an empty purse. Support and understanding cannot come from the emotionally starved. Teaching cannot come from the unlearned. And most important of all, spiritual guidance cannot come from the spiritually weak.” MARION G. ROMNEY, “The Celestial Nature of Self-Reliance,” Ensign, Nov. 1982, 93
        <br>
        “We encourage you wherever you may live in the world to prepare for adversity by looking to the condition of
        your finances. We urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid
        debt. … If you have paid your debts and have a financial reserve, even though it be small, you and your family
        will feel more secure and enjoy greater peace in your hearts” (All Is Safely Gathered In: Family Finances
        [2007]).
        <br>
        "All [people] have the responsibility to provide for their own needs to the extent possible..., they may experience financial troubles due to unemployment, overspending, unexpected emergencies, or mismanagement of finances. To achieve financial stability, it is essential that they... live within their means, save for unexpected expenses, and avoid debt."
        <br>
        "To manage finances well, [people] should establish a budget and set financial goals. They should work hard, be frugal, and save. It is also important to obtain as much education as possible.
        There are times when even after [people'] best efforts to ... live within their means, save, and avoid debt, they have financial challenges. [People] should do all that they can to be honest, work hard, strive to provide for themselves, and make sacrifices. When all efforts have been made, there should not be shame in seeking help from others.

      <h3>The Basics of Finances</h3>
      <p>
        - Learning to be grateful and becoming wise:
        <br>
        “I urge you . . . to look to the condition of your finances. I urge you to be modest in your expenditures; discipline yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can, and free yourselves from bondage. ” (“To the Boys and to the Men,” Ensign, Nov. 1998, 54)
        <br>
        - Understanding Budgets
        <br>
        "A budget is a plan. Using a budget, you plan how you will use your money for a certain period of time. Following a budget will help you and your family take control of your temporal life… Budgeting can also help you to protect your family from hardship as you use it to allocate money for building an emergency fund, paying down debt, and saving for future expenses. We cannot predict the future, and costs often arise unexpectedly. It is important to remember that a budget must be flexible—continually adjusted and improved. When you create a budget… remember that it will need to be consistently reviewed and revised. If you go over budget, don’t give up! It may take several months of adjustments before you have an effective budget."
        <br>
        - Understanding Debt
        <br>
        "Debt is borrowing money that is not yours. It typically comes with a cost, known as interest. Interest is a percentage of the amount owed. You end up paying more for what you borrowed, sometimes a lot more. Debts come with expected payments, and an overall expectation to repay all that you borrowed plus interest."
        <br>
        - Learning to Invest
        <br>
        "When people hear the term investing, they may think of a loud and chaotic trading floor with people selling stocks and bonds. While that may be part of investing, investing is also the act of putting time, effort, or money into something and expecting some type of a return. In this sense, investing is an element of self-reliance. You will explore three ways to invest: 1. Save money 2. Pursue home ownership 3. Seek education"
        <br>
        - Teach others, practice gratitude
        <br>
        "When we become temporally self-reliant, it is our duty to help others also become temporally self-reliant. One of the best ways to help others become self-reliant is serving and giving to others."  "A unified approach to financial stewardship can ultimately bring gratitude, harmony, and peace

      <h3>Budgeting Rule</h3>
      <p>
        The Essentials, Wants and Savings Budgeting Rule or The EWS Budgeting Rule is based on the popularized 50/30/20
        Budget.
        <br>
        However, the 50/30/20 Budget can be unfeasible for people with low incomes living in areas with a high cost of
        living. For example, housing, utilities and health care costs would increase over 50% of their income.
        <br>
        The EWS Budgeting rule as the 50/30/20 Budget refers to dividing up your after-tax income (earnings) among
        essentials, wants, and savings; but being more flexible, you can adjust the EWS percentage according to your
        income and necessities. A balanced budget can help you determine how much you should be spending, and on what.
        <br>
        Essentials are things you certainly have to pay, or at least you cannot live without very easily, these include things like rent, groceries, transportation, and utilities.
        <br>
        Wants are stuffs you desire but do not need that all to survive. These include vacations, dinning out, streaming services, and hot drinks.
        <br>
        Savings include retiment contributions and debt payment.
        <br>
        How it works. Know your monthly income, know how much you receive in your bank account. Know how much you spend, classify your expenses by categories and check up where you are over spending. Plan your budget avoiding debt and over spending. Fanally, follow your budget.
