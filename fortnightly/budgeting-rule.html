          <p>The Essentials, Wants and Savings Budgeting Rule or The EWS Budgeting Rule is based on the popularized 50/30/20 Budget.
            However, the 50/30/20 Budget can be unfeasible for people with low incomes living in areas with a high cost of living. For example, housing, utilities and health care costs would increase over 50% of their income.</p>

          <h2>The EWS Budgeting rule </h2>
          <p>The 50/30/20 Budget refers to dividing up your after-tax income (earnings) among essentials, wants, and savings; but being more flexible, you can adjust the EWS percentage according to your income and necessities. A balanced budget can help you determine how much you should be spending, and on what.</p>
