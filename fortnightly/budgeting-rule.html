          <p>The Essentials, Wants, and Savings Budgeting (EWS ) Rule comes based on the popularized 50/30/20 Budget.
            However, the 50/30/20 Budget can be unfeasible for those with low incomes living in areas with a high cost
            of living. For example, housing, utilities and health care costs would increase by over 50% of their income.
            The EWS Rule allows you to move the percentage of your expenses according to your necessities, for example,
            a 70/10/20 Budget.</p>

          <h2>The EWS Budgeting Rule </h2>
          <p>The 50/30/20 Budget helps you to divide your after-tax income (earnings) among essentials, wants, and
            savings. The EWS Budget is flexible since you can adjust the EWS percentage according to your income and
            necessities. A balanced budget can help you determine how much you should spend and on what things.</p>
